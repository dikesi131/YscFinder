# YscFinder Usage Instructions

## About YscFinder

> Tool Name: YscFinder
> Author: dikesi131 (https://github.com/dikesi131)
> Development Purpose: A scanning tool for discovering API Keys, access tokens, and sensitive data
> Reference Project: SecretFinder - [github.com/m4ll0k](https://github.com/m4ll0k)

------

## üìå Introduction

**YscFinder** is a security scanning tool designed to detect potential sensitive information (such as API Keys, Tokens, passwords, etc.) in source code files. It supports keyword scanning, detection of sensitive function calls, and vulnerability pattern matching, and provides both a CLI command-line interface and a GUI graphical interface for operation.

This project is inspired by [SecretFinder](https://github.com/m4ll0k/SecretFinder) and has undergone localization optimization and feature enhancement, making it compatible with the Python 3 environment.

## Graphical Interface (GUI) Usage

```bash
python3 ysc_finder_gui.py
```

### Function Introduction

- üìÅ Supports selecting a "directory" or "file" as input
- üîç Multiple scanning options can be checked (keywords, sensitive functions, vulnerabilities)
- üìä Automatically analyzes all file types in the target path
- üíæ Supports saving scan results as text or PDF format
- üåó Supports switching between light/dark themes
- üìà Displays the scan progress bar and result details

### Summary of the Operation Process

1. Select the directory/file path.
2. Choose whether to enable scanning options such as keywords/sensitive functions, not enabled by default.
3. Analyze the scannable file types.
4. Optionally, specify the specific types to scan (usually we only focus on script files, such as py, java, etc.).
5. Click "Start Scan", and the progress bar at the bottom shows the real-time progress.
6. Confirm and process the scan results (manually delete false positives).
7. Save the scan results (txt and pdf). The pdf is more intuitive and readable, while the txt file is convenient for advanced users to perform further automated processing.

### Usage Process

1. Select the directory/file to scan

![image](https://dikkksi-wiki-pic.oss-cn-chengdu.aliyuncs.com/wiki_img_2/20250615221618489.png)

1. Select additional scan categories to add

![image](https://dikkksi-wiki-pic.oss-cn-chengdu.aliyuncs.com/wiki_img_2/20250615221702925.png)

The selected options will be appended to the tool's default scan. When nothing is selected, the tool uses content-based regular expression rules for scanning by default.

1. Analyze the scannable file types and select specific files to scan

![image](https://dikkksi-wiki-pic.oss-cn-chengdu.aliyuncs.com/wiki_img_2/20250615222525261.png)

The ones marked in red are common script file formats, which we should focus on during scanning.

Subsequently, you can specify the file types to scan (separated by ;). When not specified, the tool will scan all file types in the analyzed file types. The tool excludes common static files by default, as shown below:

```python
EXCLUDE_FILE_SUFFIEX = [
    # Image files
    "jpg", "jpeg", "png", "gif", "svg", "webp",
    "bmp", "tiff", "tif",
    # Style sheet files
    "css", "scss", "sass", "less",
    # Font files
    "ttf", "otf", "woff", "woff2", "eot",
    # Configuration/data files
    "json", "yaml", "yml", "xml", "conf", "ini",
    "toml",
    # Document files
    "html", "htm", "pdf", "csv", "doc", "docx",
    "xls", "xlsx",
    # Certificate files
    "pem", "p12", "pfx", "crt", "cer",
    # Others
    "ico", "mp4", "avi", "mov", "mkv", "webm",
    "mp3", "wav", "ogg", "aac", "zip", "gitignore",
    "gitkeep", "gitattributes", "helmignore", "DS_Store", "lock", "vue",
    "pack", "db", "exe", "dll", "so", "dylib",
    "pyc",
]
```

1. Start scanning and analyze the results

After the scan is completed, the user can see the following results

![image](https://dikkksi-wiki-pic.oss-cn-chengdu.aliyuncs.com/wiki_img_2/20250615222909488.png)

Result Explanation:

- The first line is the path of the scanned local file, and the rightmost is the button to open the file (note that the file is opened using the default application set by the current system. For example, txt files are opened with Notepad by default, and word files are opened with Office by default).
- Below are the scan results for this file. The left is the delete button. During manual review, false positives can be deleted. The second part is the line number of the matching result in the file, and the third part is the corresponding matching item (format: matching rule name -> matching result).

Since the tool may produce some false positives, the user can manually confirm whether the scan results are accurate. The steps are as follows:

- Click the "Open File" button to open the corresponding file, and locate the matching item based on the file line number.
- Confirm whether it is a false positive. If it is, click the delete button to delete the matching item.

1. Export the results

![image](https://dikkksi-wiki-pic.oss-cn-chengdu.aliyuncs.com/wiki_img_2/20250615223759660.png)

The user can customize the export path and file name. The default export path is the tool's directory, and the default export file name is scan_results. The export formats support txt and pdf.

- txt format

![image](https://dikkksi-wiki-pic.oss-cn-chengdu.aliyuncs.com/wiki_img_2/20250615223935946.png)

The first part is the statistical result of the scan results, which counts the number of hits for each scan rule. The second part is the specific scan results.

- pdf format

![image](https://dikkksi-wiki-pic.oss-cn-chengdu.aliyuncs.com/wiki_img_2/20250615224112703.png)

Same as the txt format, the first part is the statistical result.

![image](https://dikkksi-wiki-pic.oss-cn-chengdu.aliyuncs.com/wiki_img_2/20250615224147070.png)

The second part is the specific scan results.

**It is worth mentioning that the final exported results are based on the user's operations on the page. That is, if the user deletes false positives, the exported results will not include them.**

------

## üìù Rule Configuration Files

All scan rules are stored in JSON format in the following locations:

- `keywords.json` - Keyword matching rules
- `sensitive_func.json` - Sensitive function matching rules
- `vuln.json` - Vulnerability pattern matching rules
- `regex.json` - Basic general regular expressions

You can customize these rule files as needed to expand the scanning capabilities.

------

### Add Custom Excluded File Suffixes

Edit the `settings.py` file and add the custom file suffixes to exclude.

```python
# default exclude file suffiex
EXCLUDE_FILE_SUFFIEX = [
    # Image files
    "jpg", "jpeg", "png", "gif", "svg", "webp", "bmp", "tiff", "tif",
    # Style sheet files
    "css", "scss", "sass", "less",
    # Font files
    "ttf", "otf", "woff", "woff2", "eot",
    # Document files
    "html", "htm", "pdf", "csv", "doc", "docx", "xls", "xlsx",
    # Others
    "ico", "mp4", "avi",
    ......
]
```

------

### Add Custom Emphasized Script Files

Edit the `settings.py` file and add the custom script file suffixes.

```python
HIGHLIGHT_FILE_TYPES = [
    "js", "ts", "py", "java", "c",
    "cpp", "go", "rb", "php", "sh",
    "pl", "cs", "h", "hpp", "ps1",
    "bat", "lua"
    ......
]
```

After adding, they will be marked in red in the GUI.

------

## üì§ Report Export

- **CLI Mode**: The results are output to the terminal by default, or can be saved as a text file using the `-o` parameter.
- **GUI Mode**: Click the "Save Results" button to save the results in `.txt` or `.pdf` format.

------

## üß™ Test Recommendations

- Run in a test environment to avoid affecting the production system.
- Combine with Git repositories for historical commit scanning to find potentially leaked sensitive information.
- For large projects, it is recommended to use the GUI to view detailed results.
